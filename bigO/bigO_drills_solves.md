### 1. What is the Big O for this?

    1. Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"

        - O(1)

    2. Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.

        - O(n)

### 2. Even or odd

    What is the Big O of the algorithm?
        - O(1)
        - runs a single operation on a single value

### 3. Are you here?

    What is the Big O of the algorithm?
        - O(n^2)
        - nested arrays

### 4. Doubler

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(n)
        - loops through each item in the array

### 5. Naive search

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(n)
        - linear loops through each item until

### 6. Creating pairs

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(n^2)
        - nested for loops

### 7. Compute the sequence

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(n)

### 8. An efficient search

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(log n)
        - data to search gets smaller after each iteration

### 9. Random element

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(1)

### 10. What Am I?

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(n)

### 11. Tower of Hanoi

    What is the Big O of the following algorithm?
        - O(2^n - 1)

### 12. Iterative version

### 13. Recursive Big O

### 14. Iterative Big O
